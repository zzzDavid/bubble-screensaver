# MacOS Bubble Screensaver

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

## Introduction

* **Tested on MacOS Big Sur 11.1**
* **Written in Swift 5.2**

### Special thanks

**This project is a latest refactor of [SwiftBubble](https://github.com/nemesit/SwiftBubble), open-sourced by [@nemesit](https://github.com/nemesit).** Many thanks to the great project!

According to the original author, this screensaver is inspired by the MacBook 12" promotional video. I love this screensaver very much for quite a long time. But the original copy is not compatible with the latest MacOS Catalina/Big Sur anymore. So, I decided to refator this project in Swift 5.2.

I used the higher-resolution video in the original repository, and updated video player and layout with the latest API.

Anyway, please enjoy this screensaver.
